# MapleSturmDiscriminants
A Maple package for the computation of Sturm discriminants

To implement: For now, the discriminant is given in terms of
intermediate varialbes. This is because the substitution is slow in
Maple: Maple seem to perform some simplifications, which take a long
time. I will think of not so time consuming substitution and
simplification.
